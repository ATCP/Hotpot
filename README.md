## Hotpot
Hotpot is an open-source, kernel-level, RDMA-based DSPM system.
It it very easy-to-use, provides very high performance.

## About the source code:
We modified several kernel source files, which means you need to compile
a new kernel and install it. Hotpot has to run on this kernel.

## Caution
This is a beta version, use under your own risk!
We will have a stabel version soon.
